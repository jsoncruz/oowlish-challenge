## Getting Started

After cloned and installed the app go to **.env** file and add your own google maps/geocoding api key

```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY="API_KEY_HERE"
```

Run the challenge

```bash
yarn dev or npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. And for the API endpoint/playground [http://localhost:3000/api/graphql](http://localhost:3000/api/graphql)

You can analyze the schemas and to the api at **graphql** and **prisma** folders at the root
